# A Workflow for Analytics Development 

This chapter attempts to break down the activities and artifacts of an 
analytics project, and to identify the skills and toolkits that will be
relied upon in this work.  We elaborate on the idea of Agile analytics
and discuss what is needed to make it possible.

## The "Black Box" View

There's a great deal of hype about analytics.  Much of what we read treats
it as a "black box", though.  What that means is that we have read a lot
about the benefits organizations can get from analytics, and a lot about
the ingredients that seem necessary for success, but much less is said about
the process by which those inputs are turned into those outputs.

I'd like to explore the inside of the black box as much as I can.

## A Pipeline to Analytics

We may think of a refinery or assembly line that defines a number of 
transformations of raw material into finished products.  At each step,
some kind of intermediate artifact or stockpile is observed. Jurney's
diagram of the data science pipeline is instructive.

Data sources --> data lake --> structured database --> data product --> happy customer

Describe this model.

Each transformation requires certain skills, and these may break down into
a number of specialized roles for people on the team.  

data wrangler
ETL developer
data scientist
data engineer
software developer
BI developer
data communicator
project manager

## Sequencing the work

Analytics are generally being used to solve a problem, and the answer to 
the problem cannot be foreseen.  More than other types of software projects,
analytics projects must cope with uncertain requirements.

As mentioned in chapter 6, the Agile methodologies can be applied to 
analytics.  They allow us to visualize the flow of work (in terms of
those intermediate artifacts and stockpiles) as if it were manufacturing
work.  This allows managers to improve their processes.

There are several core features of Agile analytics.

### Agile principles

### Just-in-time design

### Requirements discovery

Reflection: Agile combines flexibility, creativity, with discipline and
rigor.  It takes a "process" view and "team" view instead of a project
view.  Schedule is held constant instead of scope, which is ruthlessly 
prioritized.  The prof of the pudding is is in the eating.

## Tools and platforms that make Agile analytics possible

Develop and test with the same tools you use in production.

Use the cloud (IaaS, PaaS) to get infrastructure taken care of.

Encode your knowledge about models, ETL, database, infrastructure, etc. Use
version control.
