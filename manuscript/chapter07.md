# A Workflow for Analytics Development 

This chapter will take a broader view of how we approach a project starting
with acquiring data, structuring it, and making it available to end users; may
cover the cloud as well.

Talk about the roles of data engineers and data scientists, and how
analytics are used in operations.

Talk about project management (a little) and Agile analytics development.

How is analytics different from traditional project management.
