# Chapter 6: Data for Humans

The products of data analysis must ultimately serve human interests and
lead to some kind of value.  In order to become better "publishers" of
data we survey the ways that information and analytics can augment
the intellect, and identify some guidelines for how analytics 
developers should take human beings into account.

## Value from data

At the end of the day, we analyze data because we think it will lead to
some kind of **value**.  In a for-profit business, that generally means 
greater revenue, lower costs, or some other improvement in the economics
of the business.  In a non-profit, government, or scientific organization, 
value could mean any of those things, too, or it could be realized as
growth in services performed, health outcomes, environmental outcomes,
electoral success, or any of a number of other signifiers of success.

Data and analysis can bring value to individuals and organizations by
three general pathways: ad-hoc analysis, analytical systems, and operational
analytics.

- **Ad-hoc analysis** refers to the case where a lone data scientist or 
  an analytical team works on a unique data problem to find an answer or 
  provide guidance to a decision maker.  This is closely related to **data 
  journalism**, the use of analysis and visualization to tell stories
  with data.  What the two approaches have in common are that the data
  analysis is done just once, and then the team moves on to another 
  problem for another decision maker.  Acting as advisors, they enable
  decision makers to realize better decision outcomes in one-off scenarios.
  
- **Analytical systems** represent the automation of data analysis.  For 
  the kinds of decisions that are made many, many times---such as which 
  loan applications to approve, which offers a salesperson should make to
  a customer, or which aircraft need to be maintained---managers and
  decision makers benefit from having systems like business intelligence
  dashboards, data-driven mobile apps, and other systems that deliver
  the data in raw or analyzed format that they need.  These data products
  or services are built by teams that combine analytical skills with
  "data engineering" skills with databases and business intelligence
  tools like Tableau.  Analytical systems create value in the form of 
  systematically better decision making over time.
  
- **Operational analytics** is a term that refers to the embedding of
  data analysis capabilities into the front-line systems used by employees
  and customers on the front lines of a business.  Think of the 
  recommendation engines on e-commerce websites that tell you about
  products you might like to buy, or the machine at the grocery store
  that prints out coupons for just the things you might like to buy. The
  people who use these systems may not know about the sophisticated
  data analysis that makes them work, but the developers of such systems
  need excellent skills in data analysis and data engineering as well as 
  traditional software development and project management skills.  Because
  these applications impact the everyday workings of the business, they
  may potentially create the most value of all by directly increasing
  revenue and cutting costs.

## Analytics for humans or for machines?

## Augmenting the brain
### Visualization
### Hypertext

## Iterating toward enlightenment




A chapter about web application design for a data engineer, and how they make
data accessible to end users.

- You can think about web development in terms of marketing, communication, 
  customer experience, etc, but that's not the topic of this chapter.

- At its origin, the web is about a nonlinear way of connecting information,
  called hyperlinking.  Cite Vannevar Bush and Tim Berners-Lee's contributions.

- People want to go from one idea to another.

- Style ideally should be separated from content.  Mark up data with HTML,
  but use Bootstrap or your own CSS to describe style separately.  Modern
  web frameworks separate the concerns of data storage, business logic,
  and style; but it is up to you to plan out the information design. REST
  principles may help.  I think of hyperlinking and API design as another
  kind of entity-relationship modeling.

- Are there any principles for how we should consume hypertext?  Mention
  PageRank.
  
- Search engines are a vital component.

- Show how the idea of hypertext applies to analytics: drill-down,
  interactivity, and so forth.
