# Analytical Systems at Scale

Takes concepts from the previous chapter and adds in consideration of extreme
scale, the CAP theorem.  Shows how some of the new architectures (e.g. NoSQL)
are inspired by scale problems.  Introduces the "analytics platform" concept
that shows how a data lake, relational database, and "discovery" tool may be
used together.
